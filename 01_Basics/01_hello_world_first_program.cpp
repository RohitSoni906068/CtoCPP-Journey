#include <iostream> // Preprocessor directive - includes standard input/output library
using namespace std; // using namespace std; is used to avoid prefixing std:: before cout

int main() // Main function - entry point of every C++ program
{
    // cout() function displays text on the console/screen
    cout << "Hello World!\n"; // \n creates a new line after printing

    cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming!\n";
    cout << "This is your first step into programming.\n";

    return 0; // Returns 0 to indicate successful program execution
}

/*
Key Learning Points:
1. Every C++ program must have exactly one main() function
2. #include <iostream> is required for input/output operations
3. cout() is used to display output on screen
4. return 0; indicates successful program termination
5. Semicolons (;) end each statement in C++
6. Curly braces {} define code blocks
