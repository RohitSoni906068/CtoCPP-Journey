# PRACTICE QUESTIONS ON ARRAYS IN C PROGRAMMING

1. Write a C program that accepts marks for multiple students and prints the roll numbers of students, 
who scored below the passing mark (e.g., 35).

2. Write a program to calculate the sum of all elements in an integer array. 
The user should be prompted to input the array size and its elements.

3. Write a program to calculate the product of all elements in an integer array. 
The user should be prompted to input the array size and its elements.

4. Write a program to store the multiplication table of a given number in an array.

5. Write a program to find the maximum value in a user-defined array.

6. Write a program to find the maximum value in a user-defined array using the 'limits.h' library functions.

7. Write a program to find the minimum value in a user-defined array.

8. Write a program to find the minimum value in a user-defined array using the 'limits.h' library functions.

9. Given an array of integers, perform the following operations:
   - Multiply all values at odd indices by 2
   - Increment all values at even indices by 10

10. Write a program to count the number of elements in an array that are greater than a given number x.

11. Write a program to calculate the difference between the sum of elements at even indices and, 
the sum of elements at odd indices in an array.

12. Write a program to find and count all pairs in an array whose sum equals a given target value.

13. Write a program to find and count all triplets in an array whose sum equals a given target value.

14. Write a program to store the first 'n' Fibonacci numbers in an array.

15. Write a program to find the second largest element in an array using various loop structures.

16. Write a program to find the second largest element in an array using only one loop.

17. Write a program to read array size and elements from the user, then display the array in reverse order.

18. Write a program to copy the contents of one array into another array in reverse order.

19. Write a program to swap two elements of an array.

20. Write a program to reverse an array in-place without using any additional array.

21. Write a program to check if an array is a palindrome.

22. Write a program to reverse a subarray between given start and end indices.

23. Write a program to perform a right rotation on an array using the reversal algorithm. 
The program should read array elements from the user and rotate the array 'r' times.

24. Write a program to check whether a given number is present in an array.

25. Write a program to find the missing number from an array containing numbers from 1 to 20.

26. Write a program to find a duplicate element in an integer array where all elements appear exactly twice, 
except one value that appears more than twice.

27. Write a program to find the unique number in an array where all elements appear exactly twice, 
except one value that appears only once.
